# ES2015 + SCSS + GULP
This project is an example of the use of some technologies for ease the development activity
of a web application.

Currently exist other technologies more adapted for large projects, as Webpack. But I use these
scripts for very small projects that do not require a huge complexity. 

## SET UP
Change the directories of the `paths` object to fit to your working tree.

## EXECUTION
Install required software:

```bash
brew install npm
npm install
```

Traspile, minify, copy files, compress images...:

```bash
npm run build
```

For refreshing files when writing code:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

For preparing the project for being deployed:

```
npm run build:prod
```
